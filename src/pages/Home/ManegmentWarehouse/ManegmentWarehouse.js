                <p>Stock or stock inventory is the collection of all the materials and goods stored, whether for use to complete the production process or for sale to the customer. Efficient management of warehouse stock is a challenge for logistics companies or companies that have a warehouse or distribution centre since the management of the stock inventory stored will largely depend on the businessâ€™s profitability.</p>
